## üöÄ About

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game built with **React** and **ViteJS**. I challenged myself to create this in just 30 minutes, so the code might not be fully optimized, but I've tried to make it as efficient as possible. The most computationally expensive function executes in less than a millisecond.

## üìù How to Use

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vulqy/tic-tac-toe-react.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your application should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

## üî•Usage

Once the application is running, you can start a game of Tic Tac Toe:

- Player 1 uses the "X" symbol, and Player 2 uses the "O" symbol.
- Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your symbol.
- The game will automatically detect when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
